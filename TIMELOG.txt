2:15-3:50 PM foreground sprite rendering! Check it out in the lab. I have also researched how sprites work and how to draw them onto the screen. Next order of business is editing the tile map to include an arrow and gator sprite. Amazing progress!
4:55-5:50PM figured out how to adjust palette and sprites. Sprites are Hard codes from a .CHR file we can edit. We can set pallettes in C which will be written to VRAM

1:45 -3 :15 AM after raging from Fortnite, I felt productive. I created a fake menu that handles input and menu selection. That is step 0.5. This week, we hit the ground on outside memory, how the Genie worked, and actual bootloader stuff

Monday - March 25 2024
2:30 - 6:15 PM Proving (it worked) that we can read and write to an address, additionally fixing out menu logic with Patrick. We don't know the address, likely 0x00 in the zero page, but thankfully we don't need to know. Dr. Blanchard let us know where exactly to read and write.

date: March 26, 2024
time: 10:15-11:20am
task: attended meeting, took & uploaded meeting minutes. discussed hardware/software for pre-alpha build, ideas of firmware w/microprocessor to read from SD card to FPGA core

Jonas Wood — Today at 1:14 PM
date: March 28, 2024
time: 11:20am - 1:10pm
task: begun work on C code (to be executed on microprocessor) to move files from SD card to SDRAM. worked on design in pre-alpha build document

11:00 AM - 2:00 PM paging! Also remembered technical limitations (2kb ram). Discussed with Patrick and Jonas about additional microcontroller functionality in writing to memory addresses. Menu has changing pages, but a problem: longer titles do not get overwritten, leading to problems in the titles listed. This is easily fixable by brute force, but maybe there’s a better solution

Kieran Abesamis — Today at 5:23 PM
Date: Thursday - March 28 2024
Time: 1:00PM-1:45PM, 3:00PM-4:30PM
Task: Discussed Hardware next steps, Pre-Alpha Build Diagram, report for Architectural components



ADDITIONAL:
Software (Beto, Patrick, Jonas) watched videos and read wikis on how to get started in writing code that can run on the NES. This research comes to about 3 hours each for finishing the tutorials, experimentation, and reading documentation

Hardware (Steven, Patrick, Kieran) have had much research and conversation into the technicals of the project with each other and other engineers (about 4 hours). Additionatlly have their own contributions to their part of the repository (2 hours). This can be found on the MiSTer discord and private messages with Steven.

Additionally, Patrick has pushed some commits with Jonas on input detection logic (2 hours each)
